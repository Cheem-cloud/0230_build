# Setting the App Icon in Xcode

To set the image as your app icon, follow these steps:

## Preparation
1. Save the image you shared to your desktop or a location you can easily access
2. Make sure the image is square and has good resolution (ideally 1024x1024 pixels)

## Adding the Icon in Xcode
1. Open your project in Xcode
2. In the Project Navigator (left sidebar), find and click on `Assets.xcassets`
3. Inside Assets, select `AppIcon.appiconset`
4. You'll see the App Icon editor with slots for different icon sizes
5. Drag and drop your saved image onto the 1024x1024 App Store slot
6. Xcode will automatically generate all the required sizes

## Alternative Method (Manual)
If the automatic generation doesn't work:

1. Open the `CheemHang0231/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` folder in Finder
2. Copy your image into this folder, naming it `AppIcon.png`
3. Also create copies named `AppIcon-Dark.png` and `AppIcon-Tinted.png` (for dark mode and tinted versions)
4. Make sure the Contents.json file references these filenames (as I've already updated)
5. Clean and rebuild your project

## Verify the Icon
1. Build and run your app
2. Check the icon on your simulator or device home screen
3. If it doesn't appear immediately, try restarting the simulator or device

The "C" logo with the green gradient background will make an excellent app icon for CheemHang!
